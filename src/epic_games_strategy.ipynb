    "Since 2018, the Epic Games Store has given away over $14,500 worth of games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of 600+ promotions reveals a library dominated by high-quality indie and mid-tier titles, with older AAA blockbusters appearing far less frequently and primarily around major promotional windows.\n",

    "\n",
    "To analyse historical game giveaways, I developed a data pipeline designed to transform raw information into a structured, meaningful format. Because the data came from multiple sources, I focused on three key phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Collection & Cleaning: I gathered giveaway records from various sources and standardised them to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n",
    "- Data Enrichment: I didn't just collect names; I connected each entry to broader context, such as its publisher, game franchise, and original release date.\n",
    "- Final Dataset: The result is a \"semantic\" dataset—one that doesn't just list facts, but understands the relationships between the games and the companies that made them."

    "- Star Wars™ Battlefront II\n",
    "\n",
    "- Star Wars Battlefront II\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure these were treated as the same entity, I applied fuzzy string matching with a specific confidence threshold. This allowed the system to group variations together while still being strict enough to avoid \"false matches\". For matches that fell below a certain confidence score, I manually reviewed and corrected the links to ensure \"false positives\" didn't skew the final analysis."
